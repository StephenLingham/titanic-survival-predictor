# Titanic Survival Prediction App

## Description
- The app lets you input your attributes then it will predict whether you would have been more likely to survive or not if you were a passenger on the Titanic. 
- It was created during a day-long hackathon with a team of four. 
- The tech stack is Svelte and TypeScript on the frontend and Python, SciKit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Flask and MongoDB on the backend. 
- It uses a logistic regression classifier model to make the predictions, the model was trained using Titanic passenger data.
